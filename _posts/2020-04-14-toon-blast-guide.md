**Need more Toon Blast lives? See our cheat guide for life, coins, and more.**

Fans of the popular game genre Candy Crush got a nice surprise later when Toon Blast appeared in the Apple and Google Play app stores. The game features similar puzzle mechanics to Candy Crush, but with its own unique challenges and a friendly cartoon theme on Saturday morning. If you've recently started playing Toon Blast and have trouble getting through levels without spending all your lives, we've put together a cheat guide with tips and tricks to beat more levels, get more lives, and make your lives last longer. We can't promise anything crazy like an unlimited amount of game life, but with the strategies and tips we'll discuss, running out of life should rarely be an issue.

## Toon Blast Tips, Tricks & Cheats: Get More Lives And Beat More Levels
### How to Live More

When you start playing Toon Blast, you get 5 lives. As long as you beat a level, you won't lose a life, but if you don't beat it, you'll take a life. The game is addictive, so some may be tempted to use some kind of phone cheat or hack to make endless lives. However, we found there are several legitimate ways to get more lives in the game so you can keep playing

Join a Team-Teams are available as soon as you reach level 20 and are one of the best ways to get more lives regularly. Once you reach level 20, go to the tab with the team icon and try to join one that already contains many members (15 or more). When you've joined a squad, you can apply for life by pressing the chat "Ask Lives" button. It will carry you up to five lives every four hours. If you're part of an active team, it shouldn't be hard to get team members to give lives because they earn coins. Also, be sure to help any teammate who requests lives to gain coins.  
**Using Coins-**Use 100 Coins to refresh life to five. Coins can be purchased, but also won in the game. Here are some ways to buy more life coins:  
**Offer teammates lives-**one coin is awarded for each heart you send a teammate.  
**Open a Toon Chest-**all 10 levels are earned.  
**Open a Star Chest-**after winning 20 stars on levels played, you get a Star Chest. With some other treats, the Star Chest is a full fill-up for your life. You can earn 1-3 stars depending on what you score at the end of it.  
**Wait A Little While-**every 20 minutes a new life is given so if you're depleted maybe give it an hour's rest and come back for more.  

## What's life (hearts) and how do I get them?
You have 5 lives at game start. Each time you don't beat a point, you'll lose life. But, don't worry! Toon Blast gives you a free life every 30 minutes, so you'll have 5 full lives in no time.

You can ask your teammates for 5 free lives whenever you wish.

Tap the "Ask Lives" button in the Team menu to send this request to your team and every teammate can send you a free life! Sending lives to your teammates is totally free, you get free coins by helping each other out.

You can also collect stars and win a Star Chest, giving you some special gifts like boosters, coins, or life.

You can buy a life-package with your coins!

## Level clearing tips for beginners
* Search from the bottom-I usually start searching for combinations at the bottom of the screen instead of top. Working from the bottom not only helps more new cubes to drop, you 're much more likely to compact the same color cubes together.
* Think before you press. Puzzle games are generally about one step ahead. First aim is to select brick groups that are the color you need, however if there's no particular color you 're trying to find, search for certain combinations that will pull the colored blocks you need when removed. Similarly, if you have several groups of colored blocks you want to clear, first pull them near the top of the screen so you don't change their arrangement and ruin the combo.
* Look for ways to make combinations-Combos will be an early priority. The very time you merge 5 or more blocks together, you unlock a powerful combo that can really help you to clear up some big obstacles. In certain instances, you may have near each other blocks of the same color but not related. If that's the case, search for other blocks that can be cleared to combine those you need. E Below is all the combos and what they do. More information on how to better use these in the higher-level tips.
* Rocket (5 cube combo)-5 cubes together reveal a rocket. By tapping them, you build a rocket that can be used to clear horizontal or vertical blocks in the given lines, depending on the rocket's path.
* Bomb-( 7 cube combo)-this allows you to clear the 8 blocks around the bomb you create.
* Disco Ball (9 cube mix)-this mix helps you to clear all blocks of the same color. Very useful for removing a particular light.
* Seek double combos-far more effective than your regular combo. Overall, if I've made a combo, I try not to use it immediately unless I need it. I'm looking for ways to make more nearby combos to merge them for better results. A disco ball and a rocket combined, for example, put a rocket in each block that is the same color as the disco ball. Such a move alone often clears a large portion of the game board.
* Learn how to tackle various obstacles – After the first few steps, you can encounter different types of obstacles that need special moves to avoid them. Here are the obstacles you will encounter in the first 20 levels, and how best to handle them:
* Balloons-tap bricks next to them to pop them. If used correctly, a good balloon combo is a rocket. Don't use a rocket to clear blocks next to balloons, because it has little effect. Instead, seek to clear multiple rockets in the same row or column as balloons. If you're dealing with balloons and ducks, first clear balloons or stop your advance.
* Ducks-to remove them from the bottom. Try focusing on one at a time with ducks. Look ahead at the combos coming down and make sure there's a way to suit the color at the very edge, otherwise it will be hard to get them out. Rockets also serve as perfect combinations when attempting to clear ducks if you can get one correctly.
* Bubbles — Bubbles don't move, so you need to get the bubbles into the tubes. When faced with various obstacles, bubbles will prefer ducks and balloons. Rockets in the same row as a set of bubbles can effectively clear them.
